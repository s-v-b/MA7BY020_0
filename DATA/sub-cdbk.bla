           1612. We would like to know something about how people go about
           guessing words they do not know. On this card are listed some
           words--you may know some of them, and you may not know quite a
           few of them. On each line the first word is in capital letters
           like BEAST. Then there are five other words. Tell me the number
           of the word that comes closest to the meaning of the word in
           capital letters. For example, if the word in capital letters is
           BEAST, you would say "4" since "animal" come closer to BEAST
           than any of the other words. If you wish, I will read the words
           to you. These words are difficult for almost everyone just give
           me your best guess if you are not sure of the answer.

      eqwlth             should govt reduce income differences

           74a. Some people think that the government in Washington ought
           to reduce the income differences between the rich and the poor,
           perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving
           income assistance to the poor. Others think that the government

           between the rich and the poor. Here is a card with a scale from
           1 to 7. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government
           ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor,
           and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern
           itself with reducing income differences. What score between 1
